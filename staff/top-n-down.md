# Data Gathering: The Top & Down Commands
---
### Description
These two commands allow you to massively gather feedback from your community, through vote data on your server's approved suggestions. The `top` and `down` commands respectively show the most popular and the less upvoted suggestions on your server 

### Usage
Use `.top (time)` or `.down (time)` in any channel the bot can read & send messages in

### Arguments
`(time)`: The period of time you'd like to search suggestions from (see examples below)

**Examples:**
> Using `.top 1w` will show the most popular suggestions submitted during the last week\
> Using `.down 3d` will show the less upvoted suggestions submitted in the last three days

?> Use `m` for minutes, `h` for hours, `d` for days and `w` for weeks

### Aliases
• top:\
`best`, `upvoted` and `upvotes`\
• down:\
`downvoted`, `worst` and `lowest`

### User Permission
To execute this command, the user must have the **Manage Server** permission or a configured [staff](/config/staffroles.md) role


?> By default, these commands can only show up to 10 suggestions (for both `top` and `down`) but servers in our Large Guild Privileges Program can bypass this limit! More information about our LGP program can be found [here](community-programs.md#-large-guild-privileges)
