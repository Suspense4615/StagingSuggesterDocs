# Configuration Element: Server Locale

### What is it for?
This setting defines which language will Suggester use when responding to commands

### Usage
Set up the server locale using `.config locale [language]`

### Accepted Imputs
A supported locale name or code, which you can find using `.locales`

!> If a user has already configured a locale using the `.locale` command, Suggester will prioritize it. However if they haven't, the bot will respond in the language configured here.
