# Configuration Element: Prefix

### What is it for?
The specific character or group of characters (usually a symbol) used to invoke a bot command. By default, the prefix is `.` (a dot), meaning commands will be used like `.command` 
Do note that the bot mention (`@Suggester#8366`) will always work!

### Usage
Set up the prefix using `.config prefix [new prefix]`

### Accepted Imputs
Any string between 1 and 20 characters 

üìù **Note:** It is strongly recommended to avoid including "suggest" or the likes in prefixes, as it can lead to confusion for both you & your members
