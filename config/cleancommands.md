# Configuration Element: Automatic Commands Deletion 

### What is it for?
This setting controls whether or not some commands (mainly commands that get high usage or where the response is mostly indicating "yes, it worked") and their responses will be removed after a few seconds. This is useful to keep your channels clean!
   
### Usage
Set up clean commands using `.config clean on/off/toggle`

### Accepted Imputs
Either `on`, `off` or `toggle`

!> Errors related to configuration issues (such as missing required elements or permissions) will not be deleted
