# How to report a bug?
Bugs are unintended behaviors that might occur when you use Suggester. If you see a generic error message like the one in the screenshot below, it is unlikely intentional and we want to know to be notified about it so our developer team can take a look ASAP!

### Step 1: Join the support server and get the Canary role

To report a bug, you'll need to join our [support server](https://discord.gg/G5pEdUp). Once you've joined (you did right? ðŸ˜¥), head over to the `#bots` channel and run `!join Canary`, our super duper awesome bot will then give you the role which gives access to the bug reporting channels. 

### Step 2: Copy paste the syntax and fill it up with your bug
Bugs should follow the following syntax that you can also find in the `#canary-info`'s pinned messages:

> **Title:**\
> **Steps to Reproduce:**\
> 1 -\
> 2 -
> 
> **Other Notes/Screenshots to show more info:**

### Step 3: Submit the but report!

Use the `..submit` command followed by your filled-up syntax to send the bug report, and you're done! Suggester Canary will automatically send your report in `#canary-bug-reports` so people will be able to react with either :cr: if they Can Reproduce or :cnr: if they Cannot Reproduce.
